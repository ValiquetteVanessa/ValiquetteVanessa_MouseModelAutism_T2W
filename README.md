# ValiquetteVanessa_MouseMRI

#Introduction
It is my first year as a Master student in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill. Since I am still in the early steps of my project, I would like to learn as much as possible. I want to experiment with new tools and design my project to be open source friendly. I want to play around with Mouse MRI data and get confortable with the elements we learned on our first week of BHS-2020.  

# Main goals
- MRI pre-processing 
- Segmentation tools (MAGeT)
- Improve script sctruture (Python)
- Open Source
- Compute Canada
